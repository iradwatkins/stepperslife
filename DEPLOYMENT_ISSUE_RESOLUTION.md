# üîç SteppersLife Deployment Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
The website shows "Bad Gateway" (502 error) because no container is running on the server.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. ‚ùå Wrong Network Name
- **Issue**: Deployment scripts used `--network coolify`
- **Fix #1**: Changed to `--network dokploy` 
- **Fix #2**: Actually needed `--network dokploy-network` (the real network name)
- **Impact**: Container failed to start due to non-existent network

### 2. ‚ùå GitHub Actions Failing
- All automated deployments have been failing (runs #9, #10, #11, #12)
- Password is hardcoded in workflow (security issue but works)
- Network name was wrong, causing container creation to fail

### 3. ‚ùå No Container Running
- Checked server directly: `docker ps | grep steppers` returns nothing
- No process listening on port 3000
- Traefik is running but has nothing to route to

### 4. ‚úÖ Code is Up-to-Date
- Repository on server has latest commits
- Build process works when run manually
- All environment variables are correct

## Networks on Server
```
dokploy-network    overlay   swarm   ‚Üê THIS IS THE CORRECT ONE
bridge            bridge    local
docker_gwbridge   bridge    local
host              host      local
```

## Solution

### Option 1: Run the Fixed Deployment Script
```bash
./FINAL_WORKING_DEPLOY.sh
```
Password: Bobby321&Gloria321Watkins?

### Option 2: Wait for GitHub Actions
The latest push will trigger deployment with the corrected network name.

### Option 3: Manual Quick Deploy
```bash
ssh root@72.60.28.175
cd /opt/stepperslife
docker run -d --name stepperslife-prod --network dokploy-network -p 3000:3000 [... rest of command]
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check container: `docker ps | grep steppers`
2. Check logs: `docker logs stepperslife-prod`
3. Test locally: `curl http://localhost:3000/version`
4. Test publicly: `curl https://stepperslife.com`

## Timeline
- Site was working yesterday
- Deployment cleanup removed many files
- Network name was wrong in all scripts
- Fixed network name from coolify ‚Üí dokploy ‚Üí dokploy-network
- Container should be running after next deployment

The deployment issue has been a cascade of problems starting with Coolify being replaced by Dokploy, but the deployment scripts never being updated to reflect the new network configuration.
