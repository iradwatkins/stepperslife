# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Problem Discovered: August 24, 2025

### THE ISSUE
**Coolify is stuck on an old deployment from January 19, 2025 and is NOT pulling new code from GitHub.**

### Evidence
1. **Version Endpoint**: Shows build date of "2025-01-19" and version "2.0.0"
2. **GitHub**: Latest commits (c43c95a) are pushed successfully
3. **GitHub Actions**: Deploy workflow runs successfully but doesn't trigger actual deployment
4. **Website**: Missing all payment system updates ($1.50/ticket fee not showing)

### Root Cause
The Coolify webhook is either:
- Not configured correctly
- Using invalid credentials
- Pointing to wrong repository
- Has cached build that needs clearing

---

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION NEEDED

### Option 1: Manual Deployment via Coolify Dashboard
1. **Access Coolify**: http://72.60.28.175:3000
2. **Navigate to**: SteppersLife application
3. **Actions Required**:
   - Click "Force Rebuild" or "Clear Cache"
   - Ensure GitHub repository is: `https://github.com/iradwatkins/stepperslife.git`
   - Verify branch is: `main`
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Update Webhook Configuration
1. **In Coolify Dashboard**:
   - Go to Application Settings
   - Find Webhook URL
   - Copy the webhook URL and token

2. **In GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Update `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Update `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

### Option 3: Force Deployment Trigger
Create a new file to trigger rebuild:
```bash
echo "FORCE_DEPLOY: $(date)" > .deploy-force
git add .deploy-force
git commit -m "force: Trigger Coolify deployment - stuck on January 2025 build"
git push origin main
```

## VERIFICATION STEPS

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

1. **Version Check**: https://stepperslife.com/version
   - Should show today's date
   - Should show recent commit hash

2. **Payment System**: https://stepperslife.com/seller/payment-settings
   - Should show "$1.50 per ticket" fee
   - Should have all 4 payment providers

3. **Theme Toggle**: https://stepperslife.com
   - Should be visible when NOT logged in
   - Should work on mobile and desktop

---

## PERMANENT FIX REQUIRED

### 1. Check Coolify Configuration
```yaml
Application Settings:
  Source: GitHub
  Repository: https://github.com/iradwatkins/stepperslife.git
  Branch: main
  Build Command: npm install && npm run build
  Start Command: npm start
  Auto Deploy: Enabled
  Clear Build Cache: Yes
```

### 2. Update GitHub Secrets
Ensure these are current in GitHub repository settings:
- `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

### 3. Add Version Tracking
Update `/app/version/route.ts` to include git commit:
```typescript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

export async function GET() {
  const gitCommit = process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA || 
                    execSync('git rev-parse HEAD').toString().trim();
  
  return Response.json({
    version: "3.0.0", // Update this!
    buildDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    gitCommit: gitCommit.substring(0, 7),
    branch: "main",
    environment: "production",
    lastDeployment: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

## MONITORING

After fixing, monitor these:
1. GitHub Actions runs: Should trigger Coolify
2. Coolify logs: Should show build activity
3. Version endpoint: Should update after each deployment
4. Website features: Should reflect latest code

---

## PREVENTION

To prevent this from happening again:
1. **Add deployment verification** to GitHub Actions
2. **Monitor version endpoint** after each push
3. **Set up alerts** for stale deployments
4. **Clear build cache** regularly
5. **Document Coolify settings** in repository

---

**CRITICAL**: The production site is currently running 7-month-old code!
All payment system updates are NOT live despite being in Git.

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Manual intervention needed in Coolify dashboard.
