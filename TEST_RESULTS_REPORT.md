## Conclusion

While the SteppersLife platform is online and basic functionality like authentication works, the core event management features are currently inaccessible due to session management issues. The platform requires immediate attention to:

1. Fix session persistence problems
2. Restore event creation functionality
3. Enable the QR scanner feature

**Current State**: The platform can register users but cannot fulfill its primary purpose of event creation and management.

**Recommendation**: Address the session management issue as the highest priority, as it blocks access to all authenticated features.
