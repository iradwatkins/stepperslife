## üîß CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (September 1, 2025)

### 1. Event Deletion Fix
**Problem**: Events couldn't be deleted due to Convex index errors  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed incorrect usage of `by_event_status` index
- Changed from `withIndex` to `filter` for queries without matching indexes
- Added comprehensive cleanup of all related tables

### 2. Bundle Purchases Fix  
**Problem**: `bundlePurchases` table query failed  
**Root Cause**: No `by_event` index exists on bundlePurchases table  
**Solution**: Use `.filter()` instead of `.withIndex("by_event")`

### 3. Index Usage Corrections
**Tables Fixed**:
- waitingList - use filter when querying all statuses
- bundlePurchases - no by_event index exists
- All delete operations now properly clean up related data

## üìä DATABASE SCHEMA SNAPSHOT

### Tables with eventId References
1. **tickets** - Has index: `by_event`
2. **simpleTickets** - Has index: `by_event`
3. **waitingList** - Has index: `by_event_status` (requires eventId AND status)
4. **eventStaff** - Has index: `by_event`
5. **purchases** - Has index: `by_event`
6. **scanLogs** - Has index: `by_event`
7. **tableConfigurations** - Has index: `by_event`
8. **affiliatePrograms** - Has index: `by_event`
9. **eventDays** - Has index: `by_event`
10. **dayTicketTypes** - Has index: `by_day`
11. **ticketBundles** - Has index: `by_event`
12. **bundlePurchases** - NO by_event index (use filter!)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### DO NOT CHANGE
1. **Convex Index Queries**: Always verify index exists before using `withIndex()`
2. **Homepage Rendering**: Keep server-side with `fetchQuery` (not client-side)
3. **Nginx Config**: No HTTPS redirects (Cloudflare handles SSL)
4. **Delete Operations**: Must clean up all related tables in correct order

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS
1. SSH access to server intermittently fails - use GitHub Actions for deployment
2. bundlePurchases table lacks by_event index - always use filter
3. CORS issues with accounts.stepperslife.com subdomain

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Standard Deployment (via GitHub Actions)
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Your message" && git push origin main
```

### Manual Convex Deployment
```bash
npx convex deploy -y --typecheck=disable
```

### Emergency Deployment
```bash
./EMERGENCY_DEPLOY.sh  # Contains fallback options
```

### Direct Server Access (when SSH works)
```bash
ssh root@72.60.28.175
# Password: Bobby321&Gloria321Watkins?
cd /opt/stepperslife
git pull && docker-compose up -d
```
