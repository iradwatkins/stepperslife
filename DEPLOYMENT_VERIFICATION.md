curl https://stepperslife.com/version | jq '.version, .buildDate'
```

## Coolify Configuration (MUST VERIFY)

### Repository Settings
```yaml
Source Type: GitHub
Repository: https://github.com/iradwatkins/stepperslife.git
Branch: main
Auto Deploy: Enabled
```

### Build Configuration
```yaml
Build Command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
Start Command: npm start
Port: 3000
Health Check Path: /version
```

### Webhook Settings
- Webhook must be enabled
- Token must match GitHub secret
- URL must be accessible

### Environment Variables
Ensure all are set in Coolify:
```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://stepperslife.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://mild-newt-621.convex.cloud
```

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Real-time Deployment Check
```bash
# Watch version endpoint for changes
while true; do 
  echo "$(date): $(curl -s https://stepperslife.com/version | jq -r '.version + " - " + .buildDate')"
  sleep 30
done
```

### Check Latest Git Commit
```bash
# Local
git log --oneline -1

# Remote
git ls-remote origin HEAD
```

### Verify Files on Server
Check these critical files exist:
- `/app/actions/createCheckoutSession.ts` (payment system)
- `/app/seller/dashboard/page.tsx` (seller dashboard)
- `/convex/transactions.ts` (transaction handling)

---

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Add Health Check
Create `/app/health/route.ts`:
```typescript
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    status: "healthy",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    commit: process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA || "unknown"
  });
}
```

### 2. Add Deployment Hook
In `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "postbuild": "echo 'Build completed at:' && date"
}
```

### 3. Monitor Deployments
Set up monitoring to alert if version endpoint shows build older than 24 hours.
