# 🔧 Cloudflare Settings to Enable - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

## Current Status: ❌ Not Proxied
The domain is using Cloudflare DNS but **NOT** proxied through Cloudflare (grey cloud).

## 📋 Required Changes in Cloudflare Dashboard

### 1️⃣ **DNS Settings** (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Location**: DNS → Records

Current Status:
```
Type  Name              Value           Proxy Status
A     stepperslife.com  72.60.28.175   🔘 DNS only (WRONG)
A     www               72.60.28.175   🔘 DNS only (WRONG)
```

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
- Click on the grey cloud icon next to each record
- Change to **Orange Cloud ☁️** (Proxied)
- Should look like:
```
Type  Name              Value           Proxy Status
A     stepperslife.com  72.60.28.175   ☁️ Proxied (CORRECT)
A     www               72.60.28.175   ☁️ Proxied (CORRECT)
```

### 2️⃣ **Network Settings** 
**Location**: Network tab

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
- Find **WebSockets** setting
- Toggle to **ON** ✅
- This enables WebSocket connections through Cloudflare

### 3️⃣ **SSL/TLS Settings**
**Location**: SSL/TLS → Overview

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
- Set encryption mode to **Flexible** (since nginx doesn't have valid SSL)
- Or **Full** if you want to keep the existing Let's Encrypt cert

### 4️⃣ **SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates**
**Location**: SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
- Enable **Always Use HTTPS** ✅
- Enable **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** ✅

### 5️⃣ **Speed → Optimization** (Optional but Recommended)
**Location**: Speed → Optimization

**RECOMMENDED**:
- Enable **Auto Minify** for JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Enable **Brotli** compression

## 🚀 After Making These Changes

The DNS propagation should be instant since nameservers are already Cloudflare. Once you:

1. ✅ Change DNS records to Proxied (orange cloud)
2. ✅ Enable WebSockets in Network tab
3. ✅ Set SSL mode to Flexible or Full

The site should immediately:
- Load through Cloudflare's proxy
- Support WebSocket connections
- Display events on the homepage

## 🔍 Verification After Changes

Run this command to verify:
```bash
curl -I https://stepperslife.com | grep -i cf-ray
```

You should see a `CF-Ray` header indicating Cloudflare is active.

2. [Network Settings](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/network)
3. [SSL/TLS Settings](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls)

## 🎯 Expected Result

After enabling proxy (orange cloud), the domain will:
- Resolve to Cloudflare IPs (104.x.x.x)
- Show CF-Ray headers
- Support WebSocket connections
- Events will display on homepage!

**IMPORTANT**: The main issue is that DNS records are set to "DNS only" (grey cloud) instead of "Proxied" (orange cloud). This single change should fix the WebSocket issue!
