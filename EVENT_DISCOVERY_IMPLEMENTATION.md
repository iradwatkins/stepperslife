# Event Discovery & Display System - Complete Implementation

## Implementation Date: January 19, 2025

---

## üéØ QUESTION: How Events Are Discovered & Displayed

### Event Discovery Flow:

1. **Location-Based Discovery**
   - Users' location is automatically detected via browser geolocation
   - Events within 50km radius are prioritized
   - Distance calculation using Haversine formula
   - "Near Me" filter button for instant local events

2. **Smart Sorting Options**
   - **By Date**: Upcoming events first (default)
   - **By Distance**: Nearest events first (when location available)
   - **By Price**: Lowest to highest
   - **By Popularity**: Most tickets sold first

3. **Multi-Level Filtering**
   - **Event Type**: Workshop, Sets, In the Park, Trips, Cruises, Holiday, Competitions, Classes
   - **Search**: Real-time search across name, description, location, city
   - **Location Radius**: Adjustable distance filter
   - **Date Range**: Upcoming, this week, this month

4. **Display Modes**
   - **Grid View**: Pinterest-style card layout
   - **Masonry View**: Variable height cards for visual variety
   - **List View**: Detailed horizontal cards
   - **Map View**: Interactive Google Maps with clustering

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Payment System Updates
- **Customer Payments**: Credit Card (Square), PayPal, Cash App only
- **Removed**: Stripe from customer-facing payments
- **Organizer Payouts**: 
  - Split payments between multiple recipients
  - Zelle as payout option (replaces bank transfers)
  - PayPal, Square, Stripe, Cash App for organizers

### 2. Image Upload Fix
- **Fixed**: Switched from local filesystem to Convex storage
- **Result**: Images now persist properly in production
- **Storage**: Using Convex's built-in file storage system

### 3. Event Types Implementation
```typescript
Event Types Added:
- Workshop (Briefcase icon, blue)
- Sets (Music icon, purple)
- In the Park (Trees icon, green)
- Trips (MapPin icon, orange)
- Cruises (Ship icon, cyan)
- Holiday (Calendar icon, red)
- Competitions (Trophy icon, yellow)
- Classes (GraduationCap icon, indigo)
```

### 4. Display Options
- **Grid**: Responsive card grid (1-4 columns)
- **Masonry**: Pinterest-style variable heights
- **List**: Detailed horizontal cards with full info
- **Map**: Google Maps integration with event markers

### 5. Geolocation Features
```typescript
Schema Updates:
- latitude: number
- longitude: number
- address: string
- city: string
- state: string
- country: string
- postalCode: string
```

**Google Maps Integration**:
- API Key configured: AIzaSyBMW2IwlZLib2w_wbqfeZVa0r3L1_XXlvM
- Autocomplete address search
- Click-to-place on map
- Drag markers to adjust location
- Current location detection

---

## üìç HOW GEOLOCATION WORKS

### For Event Creators:
1. **LocationPicker Component** provides:
   - Google Places autocomplete search
   - Interactive map for precise placement
   - "Use Current Location" button
   - Automatic address component extraction
   - Coordinates saved to database

### For Event Viewers:
1. **Automatic Location Detection**:
   ```javascript
   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
   // Asks user permission once
   // Falls back to IP-based location if denied
   ```

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   ```javascript
   // Haversine formula for accurate distance
   function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
     const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in km
     // Returns distance in kilometers
   }
   ```

3. **Smart Sorting**:
   - Events are scored based on:
     - Distance (weighted 40%)
     - Date proximity (weighted 30%)
     - Popularity (weighted 20%)
     - Price match (weighted 10%)

## üó∫Ô∏è MAP VIEW FEATURES

### Interactive Elements:
- **Clustered Markers**: Groups nearby events
- **Custom Icons**: Color-coded by event type
- **Info Windows**: Quick preview with image
- **User Location**: Blue dot showing current position
- **Zoom Controls**: Standard Google Maps controls

### Performance:
- Only loads events with coordinates
- Marker clustering for 100+ events
- Lazy loading of event details
- Viewport-based rendering

---

## üîç SEARCH & DISCOVERY ALGORITHM

### Search Priority:
1. **Exact matches** in event name (weight: 100)
2. **Partial matches** in name (weight: 75)
3. **Description matches** (weight: 50)
4. **Location/city matches** (weight: 40)
5. **Event type matches** (weight: 30)

### Recommendation Engine (Future):
```javascript
// Planned algorithm
function getRecommendedEvents(user) {
  return events.filter(event => {
    // Past attendance patterns
    // Similar event types
    // Friends attending
    // Location preferences
    // Price range history
  });
}
```

## üì± RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR

### Mobile (< 640px):
- Single column grid
- Collapsed filters
- Bottom sheet for map filters
- Touch-optimized controls

### Tablet (640px - 1024px):
- 2 column grid
- Side panel filters
- Split view map/list

### Desktop (> 1024px):
- 3-4 column grid
- Inline filters
- Full map with sidebar

---

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Database Indexes:
```typescript
.index("by_event_date", ["eventDate"])
.index("by_event_type", ["eventType"])
.index("by_city", ["city"])
.index("by_location", ["latitude", "longitude"])
```

### Caching Strategy:
- Event data cached for 5 minutes
- User location cached for session
- Map tiles cached by Google
- Images lazy loaded with Next.js Image
