# Coolify Deployment Failure - Technical Analysis

## Summary
Coolify appeared to be working but was actually non-functional for the SteppersLife application. The platform had the app registered but never successfully built or deployed it.

## The Silent Failure Pattern

### What Appeared to Be Working:
- ✅ GitHub webhooks triggering
- ✅ Coolify dashboard showing application
- ✅ Database entries for deployments
- ✅ Status showing as "running"

### What Was Actually Happening:
- ❌ No Docker containers created
- ❌ Build process never starting
- ❌ Deployment queue not processing
- ❌ No error logs generated

## Technical Root Causes

### 1. Build Pack Configuration Error
```yaml
# Coolify Configuration (WRONG)
build_pack: dockerfile
dockerfile_location: /Dockerfile

# Reality
- No Dockerfile existed in repository
- Should have been using "nixpacks" or "buildpacks"
```

### 2. Database State Mismatch
```sql
-- Coolify thought app was running
applications.status = 'exited:unhealthy'
applications.last_deployment_status = 'failed'

-- But Docker showed nothing
docker ps -a | grep steppers  # No results
```

### 3. Queue Worker Issue
The Coolify queue worker wasn't processing deployment jobs:
```bash
# Deployment jobs stuck in queue
php artisan queue:work --queue=deployments  # Not running
```

## Why It Went Unnoticed for 7 Months

1. **Old Version Still Accessible**: January deployment was cached/proxied
2. **No Error Alerts**: Coolify failed silently without notifications
3. **GitHub Actions Green**: CI/CD showed success (only tested webhook)
4. **Dashboard Misleading**: Coolify UI showed app as "configured"

## The Fix That Worked

Instead of fixing Coolify, we bypassed it entirely:

```bash
# Direct deployment using Docker + Traefik
docker run -d \
  --name stepperslife \
  --network coolify \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label "traefik.http.routers.stepperslife.rule=Host(\`stepperslife.com\`)" \
  --label "traefik.http.services.stepperslife.loadbalancer.server.port=3000" \
  -e PLATFORM_FEE_PER_TICKET=1.50 \
  stepperslife:v3.1.0
```

## Key Indicators of Coolify Failure

### Red Flags to Watch For:
1. **No container exists** despite "running" status
2. **Version endpoint** shows old data
3. **503 errors** on production
4. **Deployment logs** empty or missing
5. **Build logs** never generated

### Diagnostic Commands:
```bash
# Check if container exists
docker ps | grep <app-name>

# Check Coolify deployment status
docker exec coolify-db psql -U coolify -c \
  "SELECT status, last_deployment_status FROM applications WHERE name='<app-name>'"

# Check deployment queue
docker exec coolify-db psql -U coolify -c \
  "SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE queue='deployments' AND reserved_at IS NULL"

# Check Coolify worker
docker logs coolify-worker --tail 100
```

## Lessons for Future Deployments

### 1. Always Verify Physical Deployment
Don't trust dashboard status - verify the actual container exists and is running.

### 2. Implement Health Checks
```javascript
// /app/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    version: process.env.VERSION || '3.1.0',
    deployed: new Date().toISOString(),
    container: process.env.HOSTNAME
  });
}
```

### 3. Create Deployment Verification
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify-deployment.sh
EXPECTED_VERSION="3.1.0"
ACTUAL_VERSION=$(curl -s https://site.com/version | jq -r .version)

if [ "$ACTUAL_VERSION" != "$EXPECTED_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "DEPLOYMENT FAILED: Expected $EXPECTED_VERSION, got $ACTUAL_VERSION"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Document Bypass Procedure
Always have a manual deployment process documented that doesn't rely on the deployment platform.

## Coolify-Specific Issues Found

1. **Build pack detection** - Doesn't fail gracefully when wrong type selected
2. **Queue processing** - Can silently stop processing deployments
3. **Status reporting** - Shows "running" even when no container exists
4. **Error handling** - Swallows errors without logging
5. **Webhook processing** - Accepts webhooks but doesn't trigger deployments

## Recommended Alternative Deployment Methods

### Option 1: GitHub Actions + SSH
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Server
  run: |
    ssh root@server "cd /app && git pull && docker-compose up -d --build"
```

### Option 2: Direct Docker with Systemd
```ini
[Unit]
Description=SteppersLife App
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --name stepperslife stepperslife:latest
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop stepperslife

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Option 3: Simple Bash Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
git pull origin main
docker build -t app:latest .
docker stop app && docker rm app
docker run -d --name app -p 3000:3000 app:latest
```

## Conclusion

Coolify's silent failure mode made debugging extremely difficult. The platform appeared functional but wasn't actually deploying anything. The solution was to bypass Coolify entirely and deploy directly using Docker with Traefik labels for routing.

**Key Takeaway**: Always verify deployments at the container level, not just in the deployment platform's UI.
