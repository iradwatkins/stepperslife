# üö® URGENT: DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE BROKEN

## CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
**Date**: August 24, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: All new features not deployed to production

---

## THE PROBLEM

### What's Happening
- **Production website is running 7-MONTH-OLD CODE** (from January 19, 2025)
- All recent updates are in GitHub but NOT on the live server
- Payment system ($1.50/ticket) is NOT live
- Theme toggle fixes are NOT live
- GitHub Actions run successfully but don't trigger actual deployment

### Evidence
```
Current Production Version: 2.0.0 (January 19, 2025)
Latest GitHub Version: 3.1.0 (August 24, 2025)
Commits Missing in Production: 15+ commits
```

### Why This Happened
The Coolify deployment webhook is broken. Possible causes:
1. Invalid webhook token
2. Coolify not configured to auto-deploy
3. Build cache stuck
4. Wrong repository or branch configured

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### You MUST manually fix this in Coolify:

1. **Go to Coolify Dashboard**
   - URL: http://72.60.28.175:3000
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Find SteppersLife Application**
   - Navigate to Applications
   - Click on SteppersLife

3. **Fix These Settings**:
   ```
   Repository: https://github.com/iradwatkins/stepperslife.git
   Branch: main
   Auto Deploy: Enable
   Clear Build Cache: Yes
   ```

4. **Force Rebuild**:
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

5. **Verify Webhook**:
   - Copy the webhook URL from Coolify
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets
   - Update COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL
   - Update COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_TOKEN

---

## VERIFICATION

After fixing, check these URLs:

1. **Version Endpoint**: https://stepperslife.com/version
   - Should show version 3.1.0 or higher
   - Should show today's date

2. **Payment Settings**: https://stepperslife.com/seller/payment-settings
   - Should show "$1.50 per ticket" fee

3. **Homepage**: https://stepperslife.com
   - Theme toggle should be visible when NOT logged in

---

## WHAT'S NOT WORKING

Because of this deployment issue, these features are NOT live:

### Payment System ‚ùå
- $1.50 per ticket platform fee
- Multi-provider support (Square, Stripe, PayPal, Zelle)
- Seller dashboard
- Transaction tracking
- All payment settings pages

### UI Updates ‚ùå
- Theme toggle for logged-out users
- New seller navigation
- Payment method selection
- Progress indicators

### Database Updates ‚ùå

## FILES CHANGED BUT NOT DEPLOYED

We've made 51 file changes that are stuck:
- `/app/actions/createCheckoutSession.ts` - Unified payment system
- `/app/seller/dashboard/page.tsx` - Seller earnings dashboard
- `/app/seller/payment-settings/` - Payment configuration
- `/convex/transactions.ts` - Transaction handling
- `/components/Header.tsx` - Theme toggle fix
- Plus 46 more files...

---

## PREVENTION

After fixing, implement these:

1. **Add Monitoring**
   - Check version endpoint hourly
   - Alert if build date > 24 hours old

2. **Test Deployment**
   - After each push, verify version updates
   - Check critical features are live

3. **Document Settings**
   - Save Coolify configuration
   - Document webhook setup
   - Keep credentials backed up

---

## SUMMARY

**YOUR PRODUCTION SITE IS RUNNING CODE FROM JANUARY 2025**

All the work we've done today is in GitHub but NOT deployed:
- ‚ùå Payment system ($1.50/ticket)
- ‚ùå Theme toggle fixes
- ‚ùå Seller dashboard
- ‚ùå All recent updates

**ACTION**: You must manually intervene in Coolify dashboard NOW.
