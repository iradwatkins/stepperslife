Location: `/Users/irawatkins/Documents/stepperslife-clean`

## üìã Step-by-Step Upload Instructions

### 1. Open Terminal and Navigate to Clean Repo
```bash
cd ../stepperslife-clean
```

### 2. Create New GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `stepperslife` (or `stepperslife-v2` if you want to keep the old one)
- Description: "SteppersLife Event & Ticket Platform"
- Private/Public: Your choice
- DO NOT initialize with README (we already have files)

### 3. Connect and Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/iradwatkins/[YOUR-REPO-NAME].git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Upload
